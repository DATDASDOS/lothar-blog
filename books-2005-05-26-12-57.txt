books

I started in on Alastair Reynolds' _Century Rain_ last night, got about
halfway through before I finally succumbed to sleep. It's a good read:
finally he gets to have at least a few chapters that don't involve pervasing
nanotechnology or uploaded personality constructs or galaxy-spanning machine
intelligences.

I was thrown at first, however, because he's got a system-wide human
government named The Polity, and just last week I had finished reading Neal
Asher's _Line Of Polity_, in which *his* galaxy-wide human government (also
named The Polity) is considerably more powerful, and somewhat less
conflicted, and certainly motivated by different things. It took me a while
to put that Polity out of my mind.
