``/usr/bin/watch`` is a little utility that will erase the screen, run a
command, sleep for a few seconds, then repeat. You can use it to follow files
in /proc without continually re-typing the command.

This program has been around since 1991. How is it that I've been unaware of
it all this time? How many other thousands of useful tools like this are
lurking on my system **right now** that I've remained ignorant of?

So the advice of the day: spend some time getting to know your ``/usr/bin``
directory. Tomorrow, make it a point to learn a new emacs keybinding that
you've never used before (if you don't know about M-/, start with that one).
