Title: Petmail

[Petmail](https://github.com/warner/petmail) is a project I've been noodling at for a couple of months now. To be honest, I've been noodling at it for over a decade: this latest effort is really a reboot of a [project](http://petmail.lothar.com/) that I did in 2003, [presented](http://petmail.lothar.com/CodeCon04/index.html) ([audio](https://archive.org/download/codecon2004audio/CodeCon_2004-02-21_4.mp3)) at [CodeCon04](http://web.archive.org/web/20110722174725/http://www.codecon.org/2004/) where Tor was (first?) presented. The original Petmail was about spam-resistant secure email-like messaging.

I decided to re-use the name because my latest project has been converging with that old one. I'm not paying so much attention to the spam problem this time, but it's still about establish a cryptographic connection between two people's user agents, and using that connection for messaging of various sorts.
