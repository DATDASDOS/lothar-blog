concurrency

Had a great chat with <a href="http://ulaluma.com/pyx/">Donovan</a> today,
about newpb and E and secure python and concurrency management. It turns out
we have some of the same ideas about interesting things to do with these
kinds of tools. He pointed me at <a href="http://www.iolanguage.com">a
language named <b>Io</b></a> that's doing some neat stuff with lightweight
coroutines, and had some interesting thoughts on coroutines in python (making
protocol-parsing code look a good bit simpler than the purely data-driven
model that twisted Protocol classes tend to have).
