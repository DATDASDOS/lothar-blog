I think I've gotten my elisp code to handle pyblosxom categories now.
pyblosxom was easy, but I have to add the glue to let you choose a category.
Unfortunately creating new categories requires manual work (registering the
CVS directory).

Next step: find a pyblosxom plugin to create that spiffy little category
sidebar I've seen on so many other blogs.
