:slug: 46-New-Blog-Software

Just finished moving the web site to a new host, and switching (yet again!)
to new blog software in the process. I wanted to get rid of CGIs on the new
host, so I switched to a static blog-site generator named `Pelican
<https://github.com/ametaireau/pelican>`__.
!END-SUMMARY!
I'm still trying to work things
out, but it's looking pretty good so far. I had to make a few patches to let
me retain the permalinks from the old (PyBlosxom) site, they're in my `Github
fork <https://github.com/warner/pelican>`__.

Managed to get everything updatable by git over git-foolscap too, for
objcap-inspired goodness.
