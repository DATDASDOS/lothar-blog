Three "simple" steps:

* are you running the right program?
  - authorship, installation/upgrade delivery path, highly-dynamic (web page)
  - what does "right" mean?
* does the program do what you expect?
  - design, bugs, protocols, crypto algorithm security
* are you talking to the right person?
  - introduction process, 3rd-party introductions, PKI/CAs
  - what does "right" mean? what's so special about Bob?
  - what does "talking to" mean: authenticated "From:"? confidential "To:"?
