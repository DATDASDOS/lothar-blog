I just got back from <a href="http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/HomePage">PyCon</a>.
Highly inspirational as always, saw some fascinating projects and some
thought-provoking keynotes. r0ml's talk in particular has me thinking about
how to structure code as a narrative, trying to bring the world of
human-to-human communication and the world of human-to-machine communication
closer together. He had a lot fo say about parallels between the development
of writing systems (the introduction of random-access pages in a book rather
than linear-access scrolls, the use of standardized fonts, the use of spaces
between words) and the development of programming languages.

I ran a Buildbot BOF, and had about 25 people show up! There are a lot of
folks out there using this thing. Very gratifying.

I spent a few days sprinting, mostly working with Eric Mangold (aka teratorn)
on a Buildbot <a href="http://buildbot.net/repos/trac-plugin/">plugin</a> for
Trac. It's starting to take shape nicely.

Also, I foolishly walked into a room where a bunch of people were playing a
PyGame space-themed production game called <a
href="http://pygame.org/projects/20/340/">Galcon</a>, and stupidly installed
it. It's amazingly addictive for such a straightforward game. Now I'm seeing
little spaceships launching and crashing into planets every time I close my
eyes. I'm hopeful that the hallucinations will only last a few days.
