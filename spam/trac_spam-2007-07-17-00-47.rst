Oh happy day! The <a href="http://buildbot.net">buildbot.net</a> trac
instance just recently got visited by the link spammers. They haven't caused
any actual damage yet, just a user account created with advertising in the
profile text, but I'm afraid it's only a matter of time before the bots
descend upon us and we're smothered by a wave of sentient AIs dedicated to
filing mass buildbot bug reports containing nothing but links to offshore
casinos and faux designer watches.

sigh.

I guess I should add some sort of "prove you can read" test to the
account-creation page, just barely enough to make the script kiddies work for
a living. Something like "what is 1+2?" or "type the word 'please' in here"
or something.

Reminds me of a suggestion someone made to me while I was working on <a
href="http://petmail.lothar.com">petmail</a>: you don't need super-clever
CAPTCHA techniques if you can manage to have a whole bunch of different
requirements instead, like each user creating their own simple technique. A
bot could be written to mass-solve any particular one, but since everybody is
creating their own, the bot-writers job is that much harder.

And sometimes, just raising the bar a bit is good enough for now. As the joke
goes, I don't have to outrun the lion.. I just have to outrun <b>you</b> :-).
