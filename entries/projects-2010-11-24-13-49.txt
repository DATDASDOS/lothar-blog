projects

Must.. write.. more. I'm trying to get over the temptation to rewrite my blog
software again (probably using [https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/ Jekyll]).
My blog-yak-shaving process works like this: "Oh, here's an interesting idea,
I should blog about it. But my blog software is kind of annoying, I should
really rewrite it first. Maybe I'll do it in git this time. (/me goes to
start rewriting it). Oh, look, it's already in git, I guess I've been over
this before. Hm, what other ways might I put off actually writing english
instead of python?".

Anyways. A few things of note from the last year:

<ul>
<li>my day job has me working on [https://github.com/mozilla/addon-sdk Jetpack],
an SDK to make it easier/safer to build add-ons for Firefox (and other Mozilla applications)</li>
<li>[http://nodejs.org/ node.js] is looking interesting: like Twisted for Javascript</li>
<li>I still hack on [http://tahoe-lafs.org/ Tahoe-LAFS] each day on the train.</li>
<li>[http://www.bitcoin.org/ Bitcoin] is my new fascination, a decentralized cryptographically-backed currency</li>
<li>I use Git everywhere I can.</li>
<li>[http://foolscap.lothar.com/ Foolscap] is still going strong. I've got a hack to let you push/pull Git over a FURL, but now that Git has better proxy-the-actual-transport support, I need to rewrite that hack.</li>
<li>My coworker Atul has a project named [http://www.toolness.com/wp/?p=678 Pydermonkey] which is a Python binding for the SpiderMonkey JS engine. I want to tie this into either Foolscap or Tahoe, to create a safe-remote-code-execution environment. I'm still trying to sort out how it ought to work (in particular, starting with what it might be good for).</li>
</ul>
