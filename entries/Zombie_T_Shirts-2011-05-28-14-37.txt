Zombie T-Shirts

Just wanted to say hi to Dave and mention his nerd t-shirt store at
<a href="http://www.nerdkungfu.com"></a>http://www.nerdkungfu.com .

He's a regular at our weekly Bad Movie Night, and I think a lot of the movies
we've screened have shown up as t-shirts on his site a few weeks later. If
you're looking for shirts from your favorite old video games, sci-fi movies,
or TV shows, you'll probably find them there. I picked up a delightful (if
dated) School House Rock

t-shirt, which I later learned is only meaningful to people within about 5
years of my own age.. guess those after-school specials weren't on TV for
very long. His Star Trek collection is pretty impressive too.
