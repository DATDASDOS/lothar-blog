Ten years ago today, I registered my little personal domain, with a woman at
best.com named Pandora, who was nicely amused by the "company name". In the
intervening time, it has been through two registrars, three hosting
companies, four IP addresses, and five server platforms. For a while it lived
as a verio vhost, for a while it ran on a Cobalt Qube on the near end of a
DSL line, and a mini-ITX board booting from a read-only USB drive. These days
it is a UML slice at linode.com.

I keep meaning to do more with it, but overall I'm pretty happy just to have
a little corner of the 'net that I can call home.
