Oh happy day! The `buildbot.net <http://buildbot.net>`__ trac instance just
recently got visited by the link spammers. They haven't caused any actual
damage yet, just a user account created with advertising in the profile text,
but I'm afraid it's only a matter of time before the bots descend upon us and
we're smothered by a wave of sentient AIs dedicated to filing mass buildbot
bug reports containing nothing but links to offshore casinos and faux
designer watches.

sigh.

I guess I should add some sort of "prove you can read" test to the
account-creation page, just barely enough to make the script kiddies work for
a living. Something like "what is 1+2?" or "type the word 'please' in here"
or something.

Reminds me of a suggestion someone made to me while I was working on `petmail
<http://petmail.lothar.com>`__: you don't need super-clever CAPTCHA
techniques if you can manage to have a whole bunch of different requirements
instead, like each user creating their own simple technique. A bot could be
written to mass-solve any particular one, but since everybody is creating
their own, the bot-writers job is that much harder.

And sometimes, just raising the bar a bit is good enough for now. As the joke
goes, I don't have to outrun the lion.. I just have to outrun **you** :-).
