:slug: 10-SPF

I've been trying to decide whether to publish an SPF record for lothar.com or
not. The last few days have seen an absolute deluge of spam from some german
bastards, much of which is being forged in my name. The only real solution
is, of course, to sign everything and make sure the entire rest of the world
knows about that practice. Or magically switch everybody over to my
http://petmail.lothar.com/ project.

But I'm starting to think that SPF might address the specific frustration I'm
feeling with this forgery. And I'm seeing about 2-3 TXT record lookups per
hour, so *somebody* out there is using it.
