Another package that appeared in debian today: pastebinit, which is a
command-line tool to upload bits of code to some of the various pastebin web
servers out there (handy when you want to discuss some code over IRC and
don't want to jam the whole thing into the channel.. it is much more polite
to put it in a pastebin and then refer to it by URL).

Now what I want is an emacs interface to this, since the code I'd be
referring to would always come from one of my emacs buffers anyways.
