I ran some stats on my spambuckets tonight, comparing which of my email
addreses get a lot of spam now versus 6 months ago, and noticed a few
addresses that had stopped getting spam altogether. This gives me hope that
by making my 10-year-old primary address less harvestable, the 500-plus spams
per day might start drying up somewhat.

So a bit of find and perl later, and my web site no longer has a bare email
address on it. I obfuscated it with just a character entity, so cut-and-paste
will still work. Now I'll give it a few months and re-run the stats, to see
if there is any noticeable effect.
