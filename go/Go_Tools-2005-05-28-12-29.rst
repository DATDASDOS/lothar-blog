I was talking with my brother-in-law about a gadget to make playing Go online
a bit more like playing it in person. The feel of the board and the THWACK!
as you plunk down stones adds a lovely touch to the game, but you don't get
that when clicking on the <a
href="http://cgoban1.sourceforge.net/">cgoban</a> window. We talked about
using a real Go board at each end, pointing a camera at it to figure out
where you've just moved and relay it to the server, and using a targettable
laser pointer (on a pair of servos) to point to where your partner has just
played.

I ran into <a href="http://www.lychnis.net/blosxom/go/index.lychnis">this
blog</a> today about a guy who's interested in part of this problem,
specifically using image-processing software to create a log of a game in
progress. He also has a link to a japanese academic paper about doing the
same thing (specifically creating a game log, aka <a
href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?Kifu">"Kifu"</a>, from a recording of a TV
program).

I visited the <a href="http://www.sfgoclub.com/">SF Go Club</a> for the first
time last week, and had a great time.. looking forward to going again next
week.
