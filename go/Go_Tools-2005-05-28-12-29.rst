I was talking with my brother-in-law about a gadget to make playing Go online
a bit more like playing it in person. The feel of the board and the THWACK!
as you plunk down stones adds a lovely touch to the game, but you don't get
that when clicking on the `cgoban <http://cgoban1.sourceforge.net/>`__
window. We talked about using a real Go board at each end, pointing a camera
at it to figure out where you've just moved and relay it to the server, and
using a targettable laser pointer (on a pair of servos) to point to where
your partner has just played.

I ran into `this blog <http://www.lychnis.net/blosxom/go/index.lychnis>`__
today about a guy who's interested in part of this problem, specifically
using image-processing software to create a log of a game in progress. He
also has a link to a japanese academic paper about doing the same thing
(specifically creating a game log, aka `Kifu
<http://senseis.xmp.net/?Kifu>`__, from a recording of a TV program).

I visited the `SF Go Club <http://www.sfgoclub.com/>`__ for the first time
last week, and had a great time.. looking forward to going again next week.
