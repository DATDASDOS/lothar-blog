I've been setting up a [http://trac.edgewall.org/ Trac] instance for
[http://buildbot.sf.net Buildbot], to make it easier for people other than me
to publish advice and tips in a persistent and easily-searchable fashion,
also to make the Buildbot web page a little bit less ugly. Trac is quite
spiffy, and I've been looking over the [http://trac-hacks.org/wiki Trac Hacks]
page at the wide variety of neat plugins that are available. In particular
the one that exposes wiki-page editing via XMLRPC (in conjunction with the
emacs wiki-editing tool) is quite intriguing.

I hope that one day Buildbot will have a list of plugins like that.
