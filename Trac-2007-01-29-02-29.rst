I've been setting up a `Trac <http://trac.edgewall.org/>`_ instance for
`Buildbot <http://buildbot.sf.net>`_, to make it easier for people other
than me to publish advice and tips in a persistent and easily-searchable
fashion, also to make the Buildbot web page a little bit less ugly. Trac is
quite spiffy, and I've been looking over the `Trac Hacks
<http://trac-hacks.org/wiki>`_ page at the wide variety of neat plugins that
are available. In particular the one that exposes wiki-page editing via
XMLRPC (in conjunction with the emacs wiki-editing tool) is quite intriguing.

I hope that one day Buildbot will have a list of plugins like that.
